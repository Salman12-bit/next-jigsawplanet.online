      <h2>10 Creative and Practical Ideas</h2>
      <p>Completing a jigsaw puzzle shows a satisfying feeling of accomplishment. After spending hours—or sometimes days—fitting together hundreds or even thousands of tiny pieces, you finally see the finished picture in all its glory. But then the question arises: What do you do with a jigsaw puzzle once it’s completed?</p>
      <p>Do you dismantle it and box it away? Display it like a trophy? Donate it for others to enjoy? Fortunately, there are many ways to extend the life of your puzzle, whether you're looking for decorative, practical, or philanthropic solutions. In this guide, we’ll explore 10 creative and practical ideas for what to do with your jigsaw puzzle after you've finished it.</p>

      <h3>1. Frame It as Wall Art</h3>
      <p>One of the most popular choices is turning your completed puzzle into a piece of wall art. If you've finished a puzzle with lovely imagery, why not showcase it?</p>
      <p><strong>How to Frame a Puzzle:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use puzzle glue to adhere the pieces together (extends evenly and let it dry thoroughly).</li>
        <li>Once dry, mount it on a sturdy backing such as cardboard or foam board.</li>
        <li>Frame it using a standard or custom-sized frame.</li>
        <li>Hang it in your living room, game room, office, or any space that could use some color and personality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Puzzle frames are available online in a variety of sizes, or you can have one custom-made at a framing shop.</p>

      <h3>2. Gift It to a Friend or Family Member</h3>
      <p>If you enjoyed the puzzle, chances are someone you know will too. Gifting a puzzle is a thoughtful and unique way to share an activity that brings relaxation and joy.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Give the finished puzzle, glued and framed, as a gift.</li>
        <li>Re-box it with all the pieces for them to assemble on their own.</li>
        <li>Write a little note about your experience with the puzzle for a personal touch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> This is a great way to promote mental wellness and mindful activities among loved ones.</p>

      <h3>3. Donate It to Charity or Local Institutions</h3>
      <p>Donating puzzles is a fantastic way to reduce clutter while doing well. Many organizations gladly accept used puzzles, including:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Schools</li>
        <li>Thrift stores</li>
        <li>Shelters</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Before donating, make sure the puzzle is complete and in good condition. Contain the primary box and make sure all pieces are accounted for.</p>

      <h3>4. Make a Puzzle Swap or Join a Puzzle Exchange</h3>
      <p>Why not go with your puzzle to a new challenge? Puzzle swaps are becoming increasingly popular in local communities and online groups.</p>

      <h3>5. Use the Puzzle for Arts and Crafts</h3>
      <p>If you're into DIY or crafting, puzzle pieces can be turned into beautiful, creative projects. Some ideas include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jewelry (puzzle-piece earrings or necklaces)</li>

      <h3>6. Make Puzzle Coasters or Placemats</h3>
      <p>Turn sections of your favorite puzzle into coasters or placemats. Once glued and sealed with a protective coat of resin or acrylic, puzzle pieces become durable and water-resistant.</p>

        <li>Mount them on cork or felt backing.</li>
        <li>Apply a sealant to make them spill-resistant.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s a unique way to repurpose your hard work into something functional and attractive.</p>

      <h3>7. Store It for a Rainy Day</h3>
      <p>If you can't bear to part with a puzzle but don't want it on display, store it for a future re-do. You might enjoy the challenge again after some time.</p>
      <p><strong>Best Storage Tips:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use zip-lock bags or mesh pouches to keep pieces together.</li>
        <li>Label boxes with difficulty level and piece count.</li>
        <li>Save puzzles in a dry, cool location to prevent warping or mold.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This option is especially useful for families with children or for those who like to revisit favorite puzzles periodically.</p>

      <h3>8. Sell It Online</h3>
      <p>If your puzzle is still in good condition, consider selling it. There’s a growing market for second-hand puzzles, especially high-quality or limited-edition ones.</p>

      <p>Feeling a bit more ambitious? If you’ve completed a puzzle with an eye-catching image, it can be turned into a tabletop surface for a coffee table, end table, or even a serving tray.</p>
      <p><strong>How-To Guide:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Glue the completed puzzle securely.</li>
        <li>Mount it on a wood or acrylic base.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>This makes for a functional, one-of-a-kind piece of furniture that will impress guests and give your puzzle a permanent home.</p>

      <h3>10. Start a Puzzle Journal or Scrapbook</h3>
      <p>Document your puzzle journey by making a puzzle journal. Each time you complete a puzzle, include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A photo of the finished puzzle</li>
        <li>Date of completion</li>
        <li>Time taken</li>
        <li>Piece count</li>
        <li>Notes about your experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is especially satisfying for avid puzzlers and can become a keepsake to look back on.</p>
      <p>Pair this with a digital version if you prefer to organize your puzzle history online or share it on social media.</p>

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
